Welcome to Dudh Sarovar - your one-stop-shop for the best quality dairy products!

At Dudh Sarovar, we are committed to bringing you the freshest and most delicious dairy products that are made using traditional methods and techniques. Our products are sourced from local farmers who use ethical and sustainable practices, ensuring that you get the highest quality products while supporting the local economy.

We offer a wide range of dairy products including Dahi, Khoya, Ghee, Masala Chach and Milk, all of which are made with the utmost care and attention to detail. Our Dahi is made using fresh milk that is curdled naturally, giving it a smooth and creamy texture. Our Khoya is made using the traditional method of slow-cooking milk until it thickens and develops a rich, caramelized flavor. Our Ghee is made using the age-old method of churning butter until it separates into ghee and buttermilk, resulting in a nutty and flavorful product. Our Masala Chach is a refreshing drink made using buttermilk, and our Milk is fresh and delicious, with a creamy texture and rich flavor.

At Dudh Sarovar, we believe that quality is paramount. That's why we use only the best ingredients and techniques to ensure that our products are of the highest quality. We also believe in transparency, and we are always happy to share information about our products and the methods used to make them.

We are a small, family-run business, and we take pride in the work we do. We are passionate about our products, and we hope that you will enjoy them as much as we do. Whether you're a foodie looking for high-quality dairy products or just someone who loves good food, we have something for everyone.

Thank you for choosing Dudh Sarovar, and we look forward to serving you!
