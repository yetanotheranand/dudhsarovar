# Ghee.

Our Ghee is made using the age-old method of churning butter until it separates into ghee and buttermilk, resulting in a nutty and flavorful product. It is great for cooking, baking, and frying, and adds a rich, buttery flavor to any dish. It also has a high smoke point, making it ideal for high-temperature cooking.
