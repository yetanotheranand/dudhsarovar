# Khoya.

Our Khoya is made using the traditional method of slow-cooking milk until it thickens and develops a rich, caramelized flavor. It is perfect for making Indian sweets and desserts like Gulab Jamun, Barfi, and more. Its rich, creamy texture and nutty flavor make it a versatile ingredient for all your dessert needs.
